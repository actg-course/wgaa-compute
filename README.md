Project Overview
================
This project organizes the results of whole genome assembly and annotation of the *Malus domestica* WA38 genome assembly and annotation.  This work was performed by the students in the HORT 503 Advanced Topics class at [Washington State University](http://www.wsu.edu).  This repository serves as a record of the project, ensures transparency and reproducibility.  The work was preformed using WSU's high performance comput cluster, [Kamiak](https://hpc.wsu.edu/).

Funding
-------
The data generated for this genome assembly project was generated by funds from the [Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission](https://treefruitresearch.org/), project AP-19-103 titled "Apple genomes for postharvest fruit quality biomarkers".

Individuals

**Sample Collection**
- [Loren Honaas](https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/wenatchee-wa/physiology-and-pathology-of-tree-fruits-research/people/loren-honaas/) USDA Agricultural Research Service, Wenatchee. The WTFRC AP-19-103 Project Principal Investigator.
- Heidi Hargarten. Molecular biologist. USDA Agricultural Research Service, Wenatchee. Collected Cosmic crips young leaves for genome sequencing. Collected various pome fruit tissues/ developmental stages and isolated RNA from these samples for annotation.
- Huiting Zhang. Postdoctoral Researcher. Dept of Horticulture, WSU.  Worked together with Heidi on tissue collection and RNA isolation. Performed tissue culture work to get Cosmic crisp roots.

**Sequencing**
- [Alex Harkess](https://www.hudsonalpha.org/faculty/alex-harkess/) and his lab at [HudsonAlpha](https://www.hudsonalpha.org/). Project Co-Principal Investigator on the WTFRC AP-19-103. Generated the 100x Illumina shotgun sequence data, the Hi-C data, RNA-Seq, and the PacBio long reads.
