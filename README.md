# Computational Resources for the Whole Genome Annotation and Assembly Course

This repository contains the SLURM scripts, Method files and other resources for all computational steps required of the American Campus Tree Genome (ACTG) Whole Genome Annotation and Assembly curriculum.  This repository was built as part of the WA 38 (Cosmic Crisp (TM)) genome assembly project performed at Washington State University. The scripts and methods are meant to help instructors who wish to use their own local compute resources.  The scripts may need to be adapated for local instances of a SLURM-based cluster or adapted for other types of schedulers.
